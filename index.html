          <h2>Wellcome!</h2>
          <p>I have built this website after finishing the planning for a new shed for my summer cottage. I thought that after taking the time to draw and calculate all materials and needs I could also share the plans to save that time to others. This is a simple shed to keep tools and store machines so it is a very simple construction without isolation. I draw it with 2 elevating doors that I will hang open with a rope in the surrounding trees giving me a rain protacted space to work. I am sharing here the plans and will share photos of the built project next summer when I will actually build it. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions or sugestions, and to sent me fotos for the gallery if you decide to build it or an adapted version of it! </p>
          <p><b>Good luck with your shed construction!</b></p>
