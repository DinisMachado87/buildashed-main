          <p>1. Drill the floor frame as shown in the picture. Note that the central shorter beams need to be a little dislocated from the lateral ones for you to be able to screw them in.</p>

          <p>2. Make the floor frame square checking that both diagonals have the same measure. If the surface you are assembling it on is not flat make sure you make the frame leveled with the help of a level tool. Screw or nail the floor to the frame with regular intervals of 20 cm or so. the 3 floor boards should be ending tight on the back and sides but will have a short space in what will be the front side of the shed where the doors will fit (check the drawing).</p>

          <p>3. Nail or drill together the wall frames as shown in the picture. Please notice that some of the vertical beams end on the top in a diagonal. The measure of the beams mentioned in the shopping list is the measure of the taller side of that diagonal. Make sure the walls are square and nail a provisory piece of wood in a diagonal acroos them to keep them square untill you screw the wall boards.</p> 
          <hr> 
          <p>Note: I draw the front wall without a down beam since all the pannels will be doors. So you will need to screw a profisory piece of wood to keep the vertical beams in the right place until you screw them to the floor</p>

          <p>Note: after this you can remove the provisory piece that was holding the front vertical beams at the right distance. </p>

          <p>Please note that the roof beams end flat with the back but have a overhang in the front.</p>

            <p>please note that you should not remove all the provisory keeping square wood at once or your shed will become crooked.</p>
