If the surface you are assembling it on is not flat make sure you make the frame leveled with the help of a level tool. Screw or nail the floor to the frame with regular intervals of 20 cm or so. the 3 floor boards should be ending tight on the back and sides but will have a short space in what will be the front side of the shed where the doors will fit (check the drawing).</p>

The measure of the beams mentioned in the shopping list is the measure of the taller side of that diagonal. Make sure the walls are square and nail a provisory piece of wood in a diagonal acroos them to keep them square untill you screw the wall boards.</p>

                        <p>Note: I draw the front wall without a down beam since all the pannels will be doors. So you will need to screw a profisory piece of wood to keep the vertical beams in the right place until you screw them to the floor</p>
